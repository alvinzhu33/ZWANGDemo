##Name: Color Switch

###Description:
We are going to remake the popular game Color Switch. Users must tap the ball carefully through each obstacle and their ball will switch color with some powerups. Users must follow the color pattern on each obstacle to cross it ! Passing through the wrong color will end the game.

##Log
5/12: Worked on README.MD file and planned out exactly what we are going to do for this final project (aka brainstorming).

5/14: Created new Setup file that sets up the basic main screen and a Ball file that you will be able to control later on. Implemented the falling ball that goes up when clicked.

5/15: Cleaned up files and made the jumping ball more smooth when going up. Created a rudimentary game over screen w/ option to replay. Made the circle obstacle.

5/17: Tried to implement ball/color collision detector. Implemented method to shift obstacles downwards.

5/18: Made obstacle rotate slower to better test. Made color-switching cirle more accurate.

5/19: Made file-wide color variable (not limited to methods). New endscreen that's much easier to test. Testing!

5/22: Implemented a better ball/color collision detector, created stars and point system, reintroduced the color-changing ball.

5/23: Started making a randomized game. Fixed resetting issues.

##Outline
###Essentials:
1. Moving ball (ball moves up when clicked, down when left alone)
2. Upwards sidescrolling
3. Obstacles (at least circles, triangles, and plus signs) and getting them to rotate
4. Borders and boundaries (game over if crash or fall to far)
5. Color switching
6. Different modes (at least two modes)

###Nice to Haves:
1. More complicated shapes/obstacles
2. High score board
3. Sound effects/music
4. Menu Screen
